jqverify
========

An age verification (or age gate) using HTML, CSS, and jQuery/JavaScript.

This age verification system is set up for Legal Drinking Age, has a JS cookie option, and works in a modal window. It could easily be adapted for other uses.

Most age verification use a mix of server and client-side code, but since age they rely 100% on honest input, there's no reason to do this.

When I went looking for a complete solution that was frontend-only, I couldn't find anything that had all of the HTML with the countries / drinking ages included, set cookies, or had a 'remember me' ckeckbox, so I cobbled this together.
